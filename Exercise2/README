# Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer

This console-based application helps astronauts organize their daily schedules. It allows users to add, remove, and view daily tasks with features to handle conflicts and prioritize tasks.

## Design Patterns Used
1. **Singleton Pattern**: Used in `ScheduleManager` to ensure only one instance manages all tasks.
2. **Factory Pattern**: Used in `TaskFactory` to create `Task` objects.
3. **Observer Pattern**: Used in `ConflictObserver` to notify users of task conflicts.

## Features
1. **Add Task**: Adds a new task with description, start time, end time, and priority.
2. **Remove Task**: Removes an existing task by description.
3. **View Tasks**: Displays all scheduled tasks sorted by start time.
4. **Conflict Detection**: Detects and alerts users of overlapping tasks.

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-link>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files.
3. Run `AstronautDailyScheduleApp` to start the application.
